# Anime Clash
The objective of Anime Clash is a memory challenge in which you should pair all the pictures with their respective pair. 

Progress Report:


December 2014-
Deciding on what will be our game.The first game that we decided was the AniWord, this game simply show a picture and its corresponding question and you will just simply type the answer for that question.We used pygame for this game. We started this game but at the middle of our work we decided not to continue the game because of some errors that we encounter.Before the December vacation our next game that we decided was Baloony.The objective of this game was simply popping the ballon. 

January 2015
We started the baloony game . We choose game salad for this game but unfortunately we lack informations on how to use the application. So again we think for another game for the third time , we clone the game tic tac toe and we started  to create the game in the middle of the month. 

February 2015
Continuation of the Tic tac toe game. Fortunately we finished the game after the technoweek.This game uses AI in which you'll need to defeat the computer itself. But we realize that the design for this game was just simple so we create again another game named "ANIME CLASH", it is a memory game. Picture will flash in just a couple of seconds and you will find their corresponding pair.

MARCH 2015
First week of march we continue the game ANIME CLASH and finish it.Finally we decided that the game that we will be presenting was the ANIME CLASH.
